            <b><u>Some Interesting facts:</u></b><br>
            <li>Messi was not very healthy and nutritious in his childhood days like the other boys around. He was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency which was
               stopping his normal growth rate at a tender age of 11. His parents could not afford his treatment, which was $900 a month.</li><br>
            <li>At the age of 17, he made his league debut against RCD Espanyol and became the third youngest person ever to play on Barcelona. At that time he was also
               the youngest player to ever score for Barcelona.</li><br>
            <li>Messi's first contract with Barcelona was detailed out on a paper napkin! FC Barcelona sporting director Carles Rexach was so impressed with Messi's skills
               that he wanted to make a contract immediately and there was no paper available at that time.</li><br>
            <li>Barcelona was so impressed with Messi's footskills that they offered to pay his medical bills and move the family to Spain just to sign him when he was 13.
               That probably explains why the contract was first signed on a napkin.</li>

          <b><u>First answer:</u></b>
            <p><b>Web 1.0 – The shopping carts & static web</b><br>
                It is the <u>“readable”</u> phrase of the World Wide Web with flat data. Web 1.0 services are presentation-oriented content viewing services based on technologies supporting static Web pages
                 without much interaction,without being given the opportunity to post reviews,comments, and feedback, used to display information. There was no active communication or information flow from 
                 consumer of the information to producer of the information.Examples of Web 1.0 applications are Altavista, Yahoo, or Netscape.
            </p>
            <p><b>Web 2.0 – The writing and participating web</b><br>
               It is the <u>“writable”</u> phrase of the World Wide Web with interactive data. In contrast to the first generation of Web sites, the contents of which were created mainly by webmasters and
                surfers, mainly consumed content, in the second generation of Web 2.0 sites and web applications provided options for uploading and sharing content on the web by surfers themselves. The
                 creation and sharing of content by surfers is called "user content". Web 2.0 encourages participation, collaboration, and information sharing.The era of Web 2.0 was characterized by the
                wisdom of the masses - a multitude of opinions, each one can respond to any interest. Blogs have become popular, in which a discussion develops following articles that generate buzz, through the
                comments area at the bottom of the article. Examples of Web 2.0 applications are Youtube, Wiki, Facebook ,etc.
            </p>
            <p><b>Web 3.0 – The semantic executing web</b><br>
               It is the <u>“executable”</u> phrase of Word Wide Web with dynamic applications, interactive services, and “machine-to-machine” interaction. Web 3.0
                is the emerging web. After Web 2.0, which is based on sharing the content of users and very interactive and sophisticated web sites, online software, Web 3.0 brings
                 the semantic and intelligent Web, so the content created by machines such as our refrigerator, music sites or shopping that can offer us Which will suit our taste
                  through recommendation systems. Even applications or information sites that create a service for us personally or search engines that find information that we are
                   happy to receive, in short, tools that actually learn what we like or want to receive and know to give it, whenever and wherever we want. The computers can understand
                   information like humans and do an intelligent choice which will be useful to the needs of the users.
            </p>
            <b><u>Second answer:</u></b>
            <p><b>Example : When you search for 'cat'</b><br>
              <li>
                In Web 1.0, you can find article or information about a cat, the information will be the same as in previous searches and is not interactive.
              </li>

            </p>
              <p><b>Example : When you watch a video or listen to music on YouTube Web Site </b><br />
                <li>
                    In Web 2.0, when you watch a video or listen to music on YouTube there is an option to comment on the current song or video and there is a possibility to search for a song or other video.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In Web 3.0, YouTube makes a playlist based on user's previous views of videos or listening to songs and it automatically transfers between the various videos without user intervention,
                     and there is a possibility to return to the same time we stopped the video earlier, when we watched it last time and continue to watch it from the same point.
